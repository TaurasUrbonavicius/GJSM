                <h2>About me...</h2>
                <p>Heya, I'm Benas Bereiša. I am a student at KITM, a school situated in Kaunas, Lithuania.
                    I am currently in my final year of high school, and I am planning to pursue a career in computer science.
                    Though my interests may remain centered around video games, web development is something I wish to explore more in depth.
                </p>

                <h2>About this page...</h2>
                <p>This website was made to showcase my achievements over the summer of 2025, which can be viewed
                    by clicking on the third tab on the left. The site itself was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                </p>

            <section class="events" id="events-tab" style="display: none;">

                    <img src="images (5).jpeg" alt="Event Image">
                    <h3>Summer work</h3>
                    <p>During summer, I took up several job opportunities from a website called Workis. Most of my work included customer service, such as working the cashier, restocking shelves, though at one point I did stagehand work at the stadium where Post Malone held his world tour. Fun times.</p>

                    <h3>Summer camp</h3>
                    <p>At around the start of august, from around the 5th all the way to the 14th, I was away at a summer camp called "Žilvitis". T'was a fun time, but having gone there so many times in the past during my childhood, it got tiring real fast. That being said, this year was my final time ever going there, so I can't complain either.</p>

                    <h3>Gaming</h3>
                    <p>Throughout the entirety of summer, as to be expected, I spent a lot of my time playing video games. Obviously. Not a lot to say here.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Sleeping</h3>
                    <p>Rest is good for the body. That being said, sleeping in warm, dry environments is not fun whatsoever. Seriously. It is not fun at all. I had to invest in a damn desk fan just so I wouldn't drown in my sweat.</p>

                    <h3>Cycling</h3>
                    <p>Though you might not expect it out of me, I found cycling to be quite fun. T'was honestly very relaxing zooming down the sidewalks, even though I did tear the chain around the gears when I pressed the pedal too hard whilst switching gears riding uphill.</p>

                    <h3>... I dunno, man.</h3>
                    <p>Look, I would have made it five events, but six is an even number and it looks better this way.</p>
