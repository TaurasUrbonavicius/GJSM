In MAIN page you can find a carousel. You need to put two pictures in places dedicated to you.
It does not matter what picture you put in it, as long as you understand that it will represent you.
Pictures must be 1:1! (Use this [link](https://www.adobe.com/express/feature/image/resize). Choose STANDARD square 1:1)
It would be for the best if you saved and uploaded a picture from a folder dedicated to that purpose (like... img/ or people/yourName_x/... or anything else.)

In MAIN page you can find cards dedicaded for you!
