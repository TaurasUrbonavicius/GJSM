It does not matter what picture you put in it, as long as you understand that it will represent you.
Pictures must be 1:1! (Use this [link](https://www.adobe.com/express/feature/image/resize). Choose STANDARD square 1:1)
It would be for the best if you saved and uploaded a picture from a folder dedicated to that purpose (like... img/ or people/yourName_x/... or anything else.)
